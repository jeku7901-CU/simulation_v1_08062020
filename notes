simulation is now working 

we just need to build an sbatch to run it

and after that, we need a parser to filter data based on amount of myoblasts/SCs being produced

python2 simulation_v2.py simulation_output_tmp.csv

-change so that the input and output file are different 
-go into directory and count csv files ls -l | wc -l 

9/4
To run everything the following steps:
- sbatch createpossibilities.sh 
- bash run_simulation_v2.sh
- we also moved everything over to scratch /scratch/Users/jeku7901/sim_output/ & /sim_possibilities_output/
- what about "simulation_submit_v2.sh"?

9/18
- Created a "createsomepossibilities.py" which instead of calculating all possible 15 division percentatges,
	it picks 15 random percents 100,000 time
- To run the simulation on a single possibilities file 

	python2 simulation_v2.py /scratch...sim_possibilities_output/ /scratch...sim_output/
